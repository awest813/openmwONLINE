OpenMW
======

OpenMW is an open-source open-world RPG game engine that supports playing Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own the game for OpenMW to play Morrowind.

OpenMW also comes with OpenMW-CS, a replacement for Bethesda's Construction Set.

Current Status
--------------

The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/?milestone_title=openmw-1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release, however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

Pre-existing modifications created for the original Morrowind engine can be hit-and-miss. The OpenMW script compiler performs more thorough error-checking than Morrowind does, meaning that a mod created for Morrowind may not necessarily run in OpenMW. Some mods also rely on quirky behaviour or engine bugs in order to work. We are considering such compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis - in some cases adding a workaround to OpenMW may be feasible, in other cases fixing the mod will be the only option. If you know of any mods that work or don't work, feel free to add them to the [Mod status](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Mod_status) wiki page.

Experimental WebAssembly (Browser) Build
-----------------------------------------

OpenMW has an experimental port to WebAssembly (WASM) that targets modern browsers
via Emscripten. The goal is to make Morrowind playable in-browser without installing
any software. **This is still an early-stage port — it is not yet fully playable.**

See [WASM_ROADMAP.md](WASM_ROADMAP.md) for the full technical status, dependency
cross-compilation details, and remaining work.

### What's working

- Browser-driven game loop (`emscripten_set_main_loop`) replacing the blocking desktop loop
- WebGL 2.0 / OpenGL ES 3.0 rendering context via SDL2
- Automatic GLSL ES 3.00 shader transformation for all engine shaders
- Persistent save/config storage via IndexedDB (IDBFS), survives browser reloads
- In-browser Morrowind data loading via the File System Access API (drag-and-drop folder picker)
- Auto-generated `openmw.cfg` on first run pointing at the uploaded data
- Single-threaded fallback for all subsystems (physics, Lua, NavMesh, audio streaming)
- Optional pthread/Web Worker support with cross-origin isolation diagnostics
- Custom HTML shell with loading progress, data picker UI, and console overlay

### Building

Configure CMake with an Emscripten toolchain and add:

    -DOPENMW_EXPERIMENTAL_WASM=ON

To disable pthread/SharedArrayBuffer requirements (easier bring-up on hosts without
cross-origin isolation headers):

    -DOPENMW_EXPERIMENTAL_WASM_PTHREADS=OFF

The full dependency build + CMake configuration is automated by `CI/before_script.wasm.sh`.
The CI job (`Emscripten_WASM` in `.gitlab-ci.yml`) produces `openmw.html`, `openmw.js`,
and `openmw.wasm` artifacts.

### Persistent storage

Saves and config live at `/persistent` (IDBFS-backed). The mount root can be overridden
with `OPENMW_WASM_PERSISTENT_ROOT`. Background syncs run every 15 seconds and on
tab/page hide events; the interval is tunable via `OPENMW_WASM_PERSISTENT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS`.

The data path
-------------

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. If you run the launcher, OpenMW should be able to pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly (installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).

Command line options
--------------------

    Syntax: openmw <options>
    Allowed options:
      --config arg                          additional config directories
